## How to run search engine

1. Make sure all utils/modules listed in requirement.txt are installed along with other dependencies.
2. Make sure you initialize the following folder in at root:
    * ii for inverted index
    * optimized (this is where the actual inverted index will be)
    * combined
    * shelve
    * and the developer folder
3. Change all file paths to your own local path
4. In roughly 40-50 minute, "ii" and "optimized" will be populated along with all necessary files.
5. Running the GUI search engine using the following command: "python app.py", a link will soon provided into the bash_prompt/terminal, click the link and you will be able to use the search engine. Press "ctrl-c" on terminal to exit the program

Optional step for text-based UI search engine:
The text based UI got more information and data, which is useful for debugging.
To access the test based UI, simply type "python search.py" and a text-based search engine would appear. use either 'ctrl-c" or type q to ends the program.
